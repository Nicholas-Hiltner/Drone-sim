How to compile:
- Using the terminal, navigate to the directory of the code base
- In the terminal, type: "make autograder"
- and "./autograder B int_1 int_2 â€¦"

Assumptions: The user runs this code on the CSE labs machines and has enough OS knowledge to pass reasonable parameters in

Q1 answer: The parallelism benefit was observed by faster times for the autograder to run. 
Performance would not improve in the same way for the default solution template, because that utilizes single core functionality.
